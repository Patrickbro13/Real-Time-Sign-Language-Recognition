<h2> About </h2>

&emsp; Nearly 5% of the worldâ€™s population is said to be hearing impaired, this creates a major problem for the communication with the deaf and the dumb, specially abled persons. To decrease the communication gap between hearing impaired community and the normal persons, we have designed a Sign Language Recognition System.
Our application allows users to show a sign on a webcam and that sign gets converted to its respective alphabet and displayed on the screen.

<h2> Functionalities </h2>

* Detecting a sign and displaying the corresponding alphabets from A to Z ( Excluding J and Z)
* Detecting a sign indicated by user on a live feed and displaying corresponding alphabet
* Forming a word/sentence from the individual signs shown by user on a live webcam and displaying that word on a screen
* Recording and storing a video of user showing signs on a webcam with its respective results in a local machine
